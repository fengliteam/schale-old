Check if the reason is as follows:
Authentication issues: Users may not have the correct login credentials to access a particular page or resource.

Account permission settings: The user's account may not have sufficient permissions to access the target resource.

Bad profiles: Profiles on the server, such as .htaccess or web.config, may have incorrect rules that cause access to be denied.

Improper file permissions: The file or directory permissions on the server are set incorrectly, making it inaccessible.

IP address restrictions: Sometimes servers restrict access to certain IP addresses.

Website owner prohibitions: The owner of the resource may deliberately restrict access to specific users.
